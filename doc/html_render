= HTML renderer =

== Configuration ==

- ``css`` table contains informations about CSS. If provided, ``inline`` field 
  will define the default behavior for css inlining (ohterwise, default value 
  for CSS inlining is ``false``).
  -- Children tables define stylesheets to include.
     --- The ``inline`` field is one more time optionnal and allow you to 
         overwrite default behavior.
     --- The ``url`` field can not be omitted.
- ``cmd`` table contains informations about command used in the document for 
  external rendering. Entries are simples ``(key, value)`` pairs:
  -- ``key`` is the name of the rule as written into the document.
  -- ``value`` is the actual command to invoke (as it would be called in a 
     shell). It **must** read from standard input and write result on standard 
     output.

```
%{
[css]
    
    [css.default]
    url = "https://raw.github.com/sagotch/pastek/res/pastek_default.css"
    inline = false # default behavior so you may remove this line
                   # produce lighter documents
    [css.custom]
    url = "/home/foo/bar.css"
    inline = true # inlining allow to copy content of the file in
                  # document header

[cmd]
   dot = "dot -Tsvg - -"

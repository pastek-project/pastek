Math block        $$$
                  &forall; a, b, c &isin; [0;9] | a < b,

                     It won't be visible in final rendering.
                     Useful if you want to add thoughts in you document
                     especially to share them with other people working on
                     it.
                  >>>
```

== Configuration ==

Configuration is written in TOML. It can be provided by a configuration file, 
a special header in a document (written inside %{ and }% tags), or by a 
combination of both. Each rendering module could expect different 
configuration, so look at their documentation for details:

  - [[ doc/html_render << HTML rendering module ]]

== Want to help ? ==

=== Test, review, find bugs ===

Play around with ``pastek``, break the parser. If you find a bug, an 
unexpected behavior or if you think something in the grammar where badly 
choosen, open an issue to report it.

=== Missing feature ===

Open an issue to ask for a new feature.

=== New output format ===

Open an issue and ask for a new output format.

Or better, fork the repo, add a module implementing the ``render.mli`` 
signature and submit it as a pull request.
